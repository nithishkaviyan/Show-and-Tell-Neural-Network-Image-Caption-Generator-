# Show-and-Tell-Neural-Network-Image-Caption-Generator

This project is an implementation of the paper "Show and Tell: A Neural Image Caption Generator" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4555). The repository contains entire code of the project including image pre-processing and text pre-processing, data loading parallelization, encoder-decoder neural network and the training of the entire network. 

Pytorch was used for developing neural network architecture and training.

The results and sample generated captions are in the attached pdf file.
